Basic Neural Net Implementation in Python

This repo has one python class, NeuralNet, which is a basic trainable neural net with backprop. For fun I decided to flip conventions and make each input sample one column, instead of the traditional one row.

This was made for my own learning purposes only. **I strongly recommend against using it for any real code**, since it doesn't integrate well with anything. It should just be used for interest.
